# CC-India
Meetings, discussions, images, marks related to the CC-India relaunch initiatives since 2018.

# Background:
Creative Commons (CC) India community in India has existed since the time the CC licenses were released. The intial community structure was formed around 2007 which gote stronger as a chapter structure around 2013 esp. during the launch of the [National Repository of Open Educational Resources](https://creativecommons.org/2013/08/14/india-launches-national-repository-of-open-educational-resources/) (NROER) launch. But with the new Creative Commons Global Network in place at the moment, the chapter is being restructured. This repo is for the public discourse for all CC-India activities.

# Discussions:
Discussions during the first ever meeting that happened in Bengaluru and Delhi (and online) were originally captured in an [Etherpad](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/ccindia1) which was later developed into a [report](https://github.com/ofdn/CC-India/blob/master/meeting%201/Meeting%20report.md). Anything beyond the meeting can be discussed as issues [here](https://github.com/ofdn/CC-India/issues).
